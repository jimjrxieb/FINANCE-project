## OPENING (1 minute)

### The Hook
> **"Constant, this isn't a toy project. This is how I work as a DevSecOps engineer."**

> "I'm going to show you a real client engagement—SecureBank, a payment platform with 160 security violations. We'll find them, fix 60 of them in 6 seconds, and prove it worked. No slides. Just terminal, code, and results."

**Pause for effect. Then continue:**

> "This is the same workflow I'd use at Fidelity, JPMorgan, or any financial services client. Let's get started."

---

## ACT 1: AUDIT - "The Problem" (2 minutes)

### Opening Statement
> "Every engagement starts the same way: **What's broken?** Let me show you how I find out."

### Live Demo: Run Full Scan
```bash
cd secops/1-scanners/
time ./run-all-ci-cd-runtime.sh
```

**As it runs, narrate:**
> "I'm running 12 security scanners in parallel:
> - **CI layer:** Code vulnerabilities (Bandit, Semgrep, Gitleaks)
> - **CD layer:** Infrastructure misconfigurations (tfsec, Checkov, Kubescape)
> - **Runtime layer:** AWS compliance (Config, GuardDuty, CloudWatch)
>
> Total time: 33 seconds. Compare that to 4-6 hours of manual code review."

**When it completes:**
```
✅ SCANNING COMPLETE
Duration: 33s
Results: ../2-findings/raw/

Stages executed:
  ✅ CI (Code-level)
  ✅ CD (Infrastructure)
  ✅ Runtime (AWS)
```

### Show the Damage
```bash
cd ../2-findings/
cat security-audit.md | head -40
```

**Expected output (point to screen):**
```
CRITICAL:  2  (Database exposed, CVV stored)
HIGH:     105 (IAM wildcards, S3 public, no TLS)
MEDIUM:    53 (K8s root pods, missing headers)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:    160 violations
```

**Key message:**
> "This company thinks they're secure. They'd **fail a PCI-DSS audit in minutes**.
> The critical issues? Database exposed to the entire internet. CVV and PIN stored in logs—automatic compliance failure.
>
> But here's the thing: I can fix most of this automatically. Watch."

**Hand Constant the printed audit report (ACT-1-AUDIT-REPORT.pdf):**
> "Here's the full report. 160 violations documented, mapped to PCI-DSS requirements, estimated $17.7M annual risk."

---

## ACT 2: APPROVAL - "The Ask" (1 minute)

### Roleplay with Constant
> **"Constant, imagine you're the CTO of SecureBank. I just gave you this report. What do you say?"**

**Expected response:** "Fix it." / "How long will it take?" / "What's the cost?"

**Your response:**
> "Great question. Traditional manual fix: 12 hours at $200/hour = $2,400.
> GP-Copilot automated fix: **6 seconds**. $0 labor cost.
> I'll fix 60 violations right now. You watch."

---

## ACT 3: FIX - "The Execution" (3 minutes)

### Opening Statement
> "This is where most consultants spend days. I spend 6 seconds."

### Live Demo: Auto-Fixers
```bash
cd ../3-fixers/auto-fixers/

echo "Fixing CRITICAL: Database exposure..."
time ./fix-security-groups.sh

echo ""
echo "Fixing HIGH: S3 public buckets..."
time ./fix-s3-encryption.sh

echo ""
echo "Fixing HIGH: IAM wildcard permissions..."
time ./fix-iam-wildcards.sh
```

**Expected output (each runs ~2 seconds):**
```
✅ Security group updated: sg-xxx (0.0.0.0/0 → 10.0.0.0/16)
real    0m2.134s

✅ S3 encryption enabled: securebank-payments (SSE-S3)
✅ Public access blocked: securebank-payments
real    0m1.892s

✅ IAM policy updated: rds-admin-role (26 actions → 3 actions)
✅ IAM policy updated: s3-backup-role (all → GetObject/PutObject only)
real    0m2.076s
```

**Total time: ~6 seconds**

**Key message:**
> "Done. 60 violations fixed. Let me show you what actually changed."

### Show Git Diff (Proof of Change)
```bash
# Show security group fix
git diff infrastructure/terraform/security-groups.tf | head -20
```

**Point to screen:**
```diff
- cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # ❌ BEFORE: Anyone can connect
+ cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]  # ✅ AFTER: VPC-only
```

**Narrate:**
> "See that? Database was exposed to the entire internet. Now it's isolated to our VPC.
> This change alone prevents a potential $4.45M data breach."

---

## ACT 4: VALIDATION - "Prove It Worked" (4 minutes)

### Opening Statement
> "Trust, but verify. Let's re-scan and compare before vs. after."

### Live Demo: Re-Scan
```bash
cd ../../1-scanners/
time ./run-all-ci-cd-runtime.sh
```

**As it runs:**
> "Same scanners, same infrastructure. If I broke something, we'll know in 13 seconds."

### Live Demo: Before/After Comparison
```bash
cd ../5-validators/
./compare-results.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
BEFORE → AFTER COMPARISON:

  Severity    | Before | After | Fixed
  ───────────────────────────────────────
  CRITICAL    |      2 |     0 | +2
  HIGH        |    105 |    47 | +58
  MEDIUM      |     53 |    53 | +0
  LOW         |      0 |     0 | +0
  ───────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL       |    160 |   100 | +60

✅ IMPROVEMENT: 60 violations fixed (38% reduction)
✅ CRITICAL: 2 fixed (100% reduction)
✅ HIGH: 58 fixed (55% reduction)
```

**Key message:**
> "60 violations gone. 0 regressions—I didn't break anything. All CRITICAL issues eliminated."

### Live Demo: Add Customer Transaction (Prove CVV/PIN Not Stored)

**Option A (If UI is running):**
```bash
# Open SecureBank UI
open http://localhost:3000/transactions/new
```

**Fill form on screen:**
```
Card: 4532 1488 0343 9012
CVV:  123
PIN:  1234
Amount: $50.00
```

**Show result:**
```
Transaction Confirmation:
  Card: **** **** **** 9012  # ✅ Masked
  CVV:  ***                   # ✅ Never stored
  PIN:  ****                  # ✅ Never stored
```

**Option B (If UI not running, show database directly):**
```bash
docker exec -it securebank-db psql -U postgres -d securebank -c "\d transactions"
```

**Expected output:**
```
Table "public.transactions"
 Column       | Type
--------------+-------------
 id           | bigint
 user_id      | bigint
 card_token   | varchar(64)  # ✅ Token, not PAN
 amount       | numeric
 timestamp    | timestamp

# ❌ No CVV column
# ❌ No PIN column
```

**Key message:**
> "See? No CVV, no PIN. We tokenize the card number. This is **PCI-DSS 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 compliant**."

**Hand Constant the validation report (ACT-4-VALIDATION-REPORT.pdf):**
> "Here's the proof. 100% of CRITICAL violations fixed, 0 regressions, live demo confirms no sensitive data stored."

---

## ACT 5: HANDOFF - "The Business Case" (2 minutes)

### Opening Statement
> "Okay, we fixed the technical stuff. Now let's talk business."

### Show Executive Summary (Browser Tab)
**Open:** `docs/ACT-5-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`

**Scroll to ROI section, point to screen:**
```
ROI: 5,784%
Every $1 invested returns $57.84 over 5 years

COSTS AVOIDED:
  Data breach:      $8.9M   (prevented C-001)
  PCI-DSS fines:   $14.8M   (prevented C-002)
  Revenue loss:    $39.0M   (business continuity)
  Brand damage:    $13.7M   (customer trust)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL:           $86.6M

INVESTMENT:
  GP-Copilot:         $0   (open-source)
  AWS infrastructure: $183/month × 60 months = $10,980
  Setup:              $5,000
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL:              $15,980
```

**Key message:**
> "We spent $15,980 to avoid $86.6M in losses. That's **5,784% ROI**.
> Payback period? **7.9 hours**—the time it takes to prevent one PCI-DSS fine."

### Show Compliance Roadmap
**Scroll to PCI-DSS section:**
```
CURRENT: 82% compliant (14/17 requirements)
TARGET:  100% compliant

GAPS REMAINING (85 minutes):
  - TLS 1.3 enforcement (30 min)
  - Gatekeeper installation (10 min)
  - K8s security contexts (45 min)

RESULT: Pass PCI-DSS audit, keep payment processing license
```

**Key message:**
> "Most consultants would say '82% is good enough.'
> I say **'82% means you fail the audit.'** Here's the 85-minute path to 100%."

**Hand Constant the ROI analysis (ACT-5-ROI-ANALYSIS.pdf):**
> "Full breakdown. Conservative scenario, pessimistic scenario, sensitivity analysis. Every assumption documented."

---

## Q&A (2 minutes)

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "How is this different from Snyk, Veracode, or other tools?"**
**A:**
> "Those are single-purpose. Snyk does dependencies. Veracode does SAST.
> GP-Copilot integrates **12 best-of-breed tools** into one workflow—CI, CD, and runtime monitoring.
> Plus, I add **context**. This isn't just 'fix this bug'—it's 'fix this bug because you're handling payment data and PCI-DSS 3.2.2 requires it.'"

---

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
**A:**
> "Every fix is version-controlled. I showed you `git diff`—you can see exactly what changed.
> Consultants review before applying. The AI proposes, humans approve. Same workflow as code review."

---

**Q: "Can we do this ourselves, or do we need consultants?"**
**A:**
> "Both options work. GP-Copilot is open-source—no licensing fees.
> **Option 1:** Train your internal team (2-day workshop).
> **Option 2:** Engage GuidePoint on retainer (quarterly audits).
> **Option 3:** Hybrid—internal for daily, external for audits."

---

**Q: "What's the ongoing cost?"**
**A:**
> "AWS infrastructure: $183/month. Engineering: 1 FTE DevSecOps ($120K/year). Tools: $0 (all open-source).
> **Total: ~$122K/year** to maintain security posture.
> Compare to external audits: $400K/year. Or a data breach: $4.45M one-time."

---

**Q: "When can you start?" (The dream question)**
**A:**
> "Tomorrow. But I want to make sure this aligns with GuidePoint's vision first.
> Can we pilot this with 5 consultants for 30 days? Measure time savings, client satisfaction, and then decide if we scale it?"

---

## CLOSING (1 minute)

### The 6-Phase Framework Recap
> "So, to summarize—this is the 6-phase workflow I use on every engagement:"

```
PHASE 1: AUDIT      → Find violations (33 seconds)
PHASE 2: REPORT     → Categorize by compliance (Act 1 report)
PHASE 3: FIX        → Auto-remediate (6 seconds)
PHASE 4: MUTATE     → Install policies (OPA/Gatekeeper)
PHASE 5: VALIDATE   → Re-scan, prove it worked (13 seconds)
PHASE 6: DOCUMENT   → Handoff to production (Act 5 reports)
```

### The Value Proposition
> "This isn't a demo. **This is my actual workflow.**
> Same process for FIS, JPMorgan, any financial services client.
> It works as a consultant at GuidePoint, or as an internal hire at SecureBank."

### The Ask
> "Constant, does this align with where GuidePoint is headed?
> Can we turn security expertise into software?"

**Pause. Wait for response.**

---

## BACKUP PLAN (If Demo Breaks)

### Pre-Recorded Output
Before demo, save output:
```bash
cd secops/1-scanners
./run-all-ci-cd-runtime.sh > ~/demo-backup-scans.txt 2>&1

cd ../3-fixers/auto-fixers
./fix-security-groups.sh > ~/demo-backup-fix1.txt 2>&1
./fix-s3-encryption.sh > ~/demo-backup-fix2.txt 2>&1

cd ../../5-validators
./compare-results.sh > ~/demo-backup-compare.txt 2>&1
```

**Fallback narrative:**
> "I ran this 30 minutes ago—here's the output. The workflow is identical."
